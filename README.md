## 🚀 How to Run the System

### ✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- Java 17 or higher (Java 21+ recommended)
- Maven (for dependency & build management)
- SQLite JDBC Driver (auto-downloaded via Maven)

---

### ▶️ Launching the System

1. **Clone or download** this project.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).
3. Run the main class: `InventorySupplier.Presentation.InventorySupplierMainMenu`

---

## 🧭 Main Menu Navigation

When the system starts, you'll first be prompted:

**"Do you want to load data to database?"**

- `1` → Load sample data into the database and memory
- `2` → Start with an empty system (no sample data)

Then you'll see the main options:

    Welcome to the Inventory-Suppliers Menu! What would you like to manage?

    1. Inventory System
    2. Supplier System
    3. Exit the Inventory-Suppliers system

---

## 🏪 Inventory Module

1. Enter your **Branch ID** (1–10).
2. Access the Inventory Menu with two main sections:

### Part 1: Core Inventory Functions

- Show item details
- Add/remove items
- Mark item as defective
- Update cost prices
- Apply supplier/store discounts
- Generate inventory & shortage reports
- Update demand/supply parameters
- Change storage location

### Part 2: Order Management & Tracking

- **Show Shortage Alerts for this branch** - View current shortages without updating inventory
- Update Periodic Order - Modify recurring supplier orders
- **Place Supplier Order Due to Shortage** - Process existing orders and detect new shortages
- View All Periodic Orders - Display all recurring orders for the branch
- View Pending Shortage Orders - Show orders awaiting delivery

**Note:** The "View Current Periodic Orders In Transit" functionality has been removed for streamlined operation.

Data is retrieved using DAOs and Repository patterns. Branch-specific operations are respected.

---

## 📦 Supplier Module

When selected:

- A sample dataset of **8 suppliers**, **agreements**, **products supplied**, and **discounts** is optionally loaded.
- You can:

  - Search supplier
  - Create supplier + agreement + product
  - View past supplier orders
  - Return to the main menu

All related tables are initialized via DAOs.

---

## ❌ Exit Option

- Selecting `3` will **clear all data**:
  - Inventory: products, items, orders, discounts
  - Supplier: suppliers, agreements, discounts, etc.
- Console confirms deletion.

All tables are created **dynamically** at runtime using the DAO layer.
Data is inserted through DTO-based preloaders if chosen during startup.

## 💡 Notes

- DAO classes are responsible for table creation (`createTableIfNotExists`) and insertion.
- Data preloaders avoid duplication: check if product/item already exists before inserting.
- Periodic orders and shortage orders work alongside inventory & supplier systems.
- **Enhanced shortage processing**: Function 3 now always processes existing orders AND detects new shortages.
- **Simplified alerts**: Function 1 now focuses solely on displaying shortage alerts without inventory updates.
- **Streamlined menu**: Removed redundant "View Current Periodic Orders In Transit" functionality.
- When exiting, all tables are cleared in proper dependency order.
