- **Ran Erez** ‚Äì 207285362

## üöÄ How to Run the System

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

- Java 17 or higher (Java 21+ recommended)
- Maven (for dependency & build management)
- SQLite JDBC Driver (auto-downloaded via Maven)

---

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Launching the System

1. **Clone or download** this project.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ).
3. Run the main class: `InventorySupplier.Presentation.InventorySupplierMainMenu`

---

## üß≠ Main Menu Navigation

When the system starts, you'll first be prompted:

**"Do you want to load data to database?"**

- `1` ‚Üí Load sample data into the database and memory
- `2` ‚Üí Start with an empty system (no sample data)

Then you'll see the main options:

    Welcome to the Inventory-Suppliers Menu! What would you like to manage?

    1. Inventory System  
    2. Supplier System  
    3. Exit the Inventory-Suppliers system

---

## üè™ Inventory Module

1. Enter your **Branch ID** (1‚Äì10).
2. Access the Inventory Menu, which includes:

- Show item details
- Add/remove items
- Mark item as defective
- Update cost prices
- Apply supplier/store discounts
- Inventory & shortage reports
- Update demand/supply parameters
- Change storage location
- Exit inventory menu

Data is retrieved using DAOs and Repository patterns. Branch-specific operations are respected.

---

## üì¶ Supplier Module

When selected:

- A sample dataset of **8 suppliers**, **agreements**, **products supplied**, and **discounts** is optionally loaded.
- You can:

   - Search supplier
   - Create supplier + agreement + product
   - View past supplier orders
   - Return to the main menu

All related tables are initialized via DAOs.

---

## ‚ùå Exit Option

- Selecting `3` will **clear all data**:
   - Inventory: products, items, orders, discounts
   - Supplier: suppliers, agreements, discounts, etc.
- Console confirms deletion.

## üí° Notes

- DAO classes are responsible for table creation (`createTableIfNotExists`) and insertion.
- Data preloaders avoid duplication: check if product/item already exists before inserting.
- Periodic orders and shortage orders work alongside inventory & supplier systems.
- When exiting, all tables are cleared in proper dependency order.
